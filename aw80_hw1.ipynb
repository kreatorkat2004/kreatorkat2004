        "* When displaying DataFrames, please do not include `.head()` or `.tail()` calls unless specifically asked to. Just removing these calls will work as well, and will allow us to see both the beginning and end of your DataFrames, which help us ensure data is processed properly.

        "* Generally, please keep your notebook cells to one solution per cell, and preserve the order of the questions asked.\n",
        "* Finally, this can be harder to check/control and depends on which plotting libraries you prefer, but it would be helpful to limit the size/resolution of plot images in the notebook. Our grading platform has an upper limit on submission sizes it can display, and high-res plots are the usual culprit when submissions are hidden or truncated."
